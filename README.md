# Comic Creator App

The wep application enables users to create a 10 panel comic of images and text annotations. The user needs to enter the image description and corresponding text narrative for each panel. The image descriptions are sent to a text-to-image API, fetching images that harmonize with the panel's theme. The images along with the text descriptions are displayed in a neat comic strip format.
